# wine-quality-prediction
The comparison shows that the Adam optimizer outperforms the prediction of wine quality than Gradient descent, so we use Adam as an optimization algorithm and the optimized network that can make the best prediction is obtained. The detailed architecture and the working of ANNs can be found elsewhere.
